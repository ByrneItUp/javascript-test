let n = prompt('Enter a number to see primes smaller than this', '');

alertPrime: for (let i=1; i<n; i++) { // this rotates through numbers up to n and alerts them

  for (let j=2; j<i; j++) { // this checks if number i is prime or not
    if (i % j == 0) continue alertPrime;} // if not prime then start i loop again

alert(i);
}




first loop > outputs integers if prime
  if i<n then output

second loop > checks if integer is prime or not by dividing by all numbers up to itself
  if i%j == 0 NOT PRIME
  if i%j !==0 IS PRIME
  this needs to loop until j<i to establish that all results of i%j do not == 0 to continue to alert(i)
